UX Portfolio website for Schuyler Christensen. Single page app with a section for projects, hosting my resume, and a contact form. Hosted in GitHub and forms are via Freeform. 

Mostly a place for me to play around and put some of the UX work I'm doing on the side as I learn the ins and outs. 

TODO: Might figure out a way to add Product Management portfolio items, and separate the areas.
