description: Given the prompt of designing a mobile app for a modern pub food delivery app, I iterated through the design processes of empathize, define, and ideate. This first case study comprehensively covered everything from wireframes and prototypes, to testing and accessibility. As a Product Manager, I find it beyond interesting to take a step into the world of those I work closely with in my day to day. Learning not only the methodology, but the why and thought process behind it, was truly exciting and insightful.
